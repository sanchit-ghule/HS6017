<!-- l. 293 --><p class='noindent'>If there is a way to go back in the past, maybe using Time Machine, there are few things
which needs to re-invent, or rather better Uninvent! <br class='newline' />
</p><!-- l. 295 --><p class='indent'>   As innovators we should always look past that excited us for our idea, an idea or an
invention which gonna change the world, change people’s life, change our organisation,
which is really taken to a brief look at history of an idea, and where did it possibly go
wrong, where was its use resulted in something negative or unintended consequence.
<br class='newline' />What would be unintended consequences of our ideas? <br class='newline' />What are the ways that some idea can be use in unintended ways? <br class='newline' />How our idea could be misused? <br class='newline' />Of course some of them can be positive but some of them can be negative also!
<br class='newline' />What is Ethical Innovation? <br class='newline' />Rather talking what we should do in future, possibly we have to take a look at how could
our idea be misused in future! <br class='newline' />Because most, if not all innovations can be both good and bad, and it’s important as an
innovator that we go with our eyes wide open. Look what happened historically, and if
we could rewind the clock! What we have done differently!

<!-- l. 308 --><p class='noindent'>An atomic bomb is perfect example where something is good and something is not so
good. The use of atom for medicine, Atomic energy these all are phenomenal inventions.
But the atomic bombs use as a weapons, now being used as deterrence, if we have
magic, better to keep it’s good use. <br class='newline' />Let’s get rid of the atomic bomb!

<!-- l. 314 --><p class='noindent'>People have been commenting on social media in negative effects. in many ways social
media turns into echo chamber, in fact it amplifies based on some algorithm, things like
opinions, discussions, common things etc. social media used algorithms to amplify
those kind of messages is just a bad thing. It is a misuse of communities, it’s a misuse of
friendships, it’s a misuse of data and information manipulation, and just intellectual
gymnastics. <br class='newline' />There are ways to use social media in good way.

<!-- l. 320 --><p class='noindent'>These are the cameras that municipalities post up on traffic lights or down the streets and
they clock us, they snap our pictures, and sends us automatic tickets, Which has good
results in terms of safety. But many of the GPS systems will tell you when you are
comeing up on a red light camera or speed camera, and you adjust your speed
accordingly, so does it really help? <br class='newline' />The good part is we will get automatic bills for our car toll or bus ticket using these
efficient systems. But these are being misused, many companies are approaching
                                                                          

                                                                          
municipalities saying that we will install the cameras for free, we will install the red light
cameras for free, and split the toal you get. And businesses get money of illegal
activities.

<!-- l. 326 --><p class='noindent'>These are the callers that are trying to sell us contracts about automobiles, telemarketing
campaigns etc, and these robo callers are the real pain. Many people are getting around 8
to 10 calls per day from robo callers. It is just a result of innovation, telephone systems
are going digital, voice over IP (VoIP), generated calls are doorways for the invention of
Robo calls. <br class='newline' />Now the inventors of VoIP could not think about the fact that their VoIP could be
misused. Developers can easily write some software on computers or laptops or the
servers and can generate thousands and thousands of calls simultaneously, call
regulators are not able to keep up with this kind of innovation. Could the innovators or
the regulators would have shut that down in the past! By making it illegal earlier!
<br class='newline' /> [However politicians love Robo callers to get their election campaign going]

<!-- l. 333 --><p class='noindent'>This is particularly started pre-World War I, with inventions of things like mustard gas!
<br class='newline' />What is the use of mustard gas? Other than harm or kill people! <br class='newline' />Now, because we have invented, we opened whole Pandora’s box. Now countries are
working in this area primary as deterrents. There are all kinds of treaties saying that
nobody can work in biological weapons, But we never know! <br class='newline' /> [Call me a sceptic]

   <h4 class='subsectionHead'><span class='titlemark'>2.1.6    </span> <a id='x4-210002.1.6'></a>Tobacco and Cigarettes</h4>
<!-- l. 341 --><p class='noindent'>Tobacco is being around from long time, long before even the arrival of Europeans to the
United States, tobacco was actually a crop of the Indians, we exported it to Europe etc.
And spread that throughout the world. <br class='newline' />Some of the people are Tobacco farmers, tobacco harvesting, and it feels a
livelihood, but tobacco is very negative it’s a ubductive, it’s bad for health.
<br class='newline' />Probably we can’t argue against the negative effects of tobacco, particularly cigarettes
have had on people’s health, lives, mental costs, longevity etc.

   <h4 class='subsectionHead'><span class='titlemark'>2.1.7    </span> <a id='x4-220002.1.7'></a>Plastic</h4>
<!-- l. 348 --><p class='noindent'>Plastic actually has a lot of positive effects, including in areas of medicine, Certain
devices that actually get inserted into the body now. <br class='newline' />The early version of plastic which never degraded, never decomposed is the real
problem. Think about all the plastic in the ocean, all the plastic on the landfills, which
has never degraded. This is a good example though where something was invented there
is a unintended consequence and then that actually encourage innovators to go solve that
problem, (to solve unintended consequence problem). In a form of plastic, are there
other things that can be invented, that could serve the same purpose as plastic,
but that are biodegradable. e.g. plastic bags, things such as sealed food etc.
<br class='newline' />Is there an alternative packaging which reduces the need of requirement of plastic? I
think this could encourage some interesting innovations!

   <h4 class='subsectionHead'><span class='titlemark'>2.1.8    </span> <a id='x4-230002.1.8'></a>Computer Viruses and Malwares</h4>
<!-- l. 355 --><p class='noindent'>The early days of computer viruses, it is not done as negative thing, it was basically used
to keep track of illegal copies of softwares. In early days of softwares, people would
make illegal coppies and everybody just distribute and duplicate sorts of discs,
publishers are trying to shut down that therefore created a bits of code which would keep
a track of who was the original license key owner and who tried to subsequent copying
for each generation of the original copy. Ultimately trying to trace back it’s original
duplicate. <br class='newline' />There is a lot of energy and time spent on these in early days (mid 70s and
early 80s). Originally it was intended for good but got twisted for bad, now
that’s turned into malwares which results in all kinds of nastiness around the
web.

   <h4 class='subsectionHead'><span class='titlemark'>2.1.9    </span> <a id='x4-240002.1.9'></a>Over Use Of Chemicals In Food</h4>
<!-- l. 361 --><p class='noindent'>Today if we read the ingredients list of all the foods we eat or drink, the number of
chemicals that are there, a lot more chemicals that are just there for the benefit of
producers, make a food nice or last it longer, be more stable during shipment, lower
cost of same food which gives the same test, which all has many unintended
health consequences. Example of replacing sugar with hyper-sucrose/fructose
etc.
