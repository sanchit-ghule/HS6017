<!-- l. 154 --><p class='noindent'>We probably cannot remember every single fact or skill we were taught when we were at
school. Our memories fade over time, and if we don’t practice the skills that we’ve been
taught regularly, we eventually forget how to use them at all. That doesn’t just apply to
individual people, though - that applies to the whole human race! There’s plenty of
evidence that our ancestors had various skills and abilities that we lack today, and we
will try to cover various technologies, which existed even today! Which is even more
relevant than today’s hi-fi technology!
</p><!-- l. 156 --><p class='indent'>   We often believe that modern science to be the zenith for the humanity thus far.
Incorrectly perceiving technology as a modern craft, but some societies of the past were
actually significantly more creative than we ever give them credit for. Not only the craft
technology we are still useing today, but sometimes they were designed things that we
still fully don’t understand yet. These are the oldest technologies that scientists Can’t
explain !
