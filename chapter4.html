<!-- l. 422 --><p class='noindent'>Once we buy something, do we own it? do we really own it? like we can do whatever we
want with that thing? It sounds a very simple question but there are actually a lot of
limits to what exactly we can do with what we own. Let’s say we buy a car, we get the
title saying we own it, it’s ours ! and we can do whatever with it, driving it somewhere,
but yup we cannot drive over certain speed in certain places, hmm that’s limit, we get it,
due to some safety reasons. If we consider another example of printer, we can print
whatever we want, but what happens if we start photocopying money? it will just doesnt
let us ! So there are certain limits that we accept for every thing which we
own.

   <h4 class='subsectionHead'><span class='titlemark'>4.1.1    </span> <a id='x6-320004.1.1'></a>Right to Repair</h4>
<!-- l. 427 --><p class='noindent'>If we own something, and if that breaks, should we be allowed to repair it? fix it? That
should be pretty easy ! No one is gonna stop us for doing that, there is no such law which
prevents repairing, it’s almost impossible to actually do it. it’s the companies that makes
the things, that often we trying to repair, they are trying to stop us, before even we get
that far. <br class='newline' />A piece of technology which we own, and part of it breaks, so there are two sides, (of
course there are two sides for every coin), one is the user side and there is a
manufacturer side. User side is just easy to understand because we should just be able to
repair that thing and keep using that technology. Of course we should be able to repair
technology which we own, and there are millions of great reasons to do it, repair saves
the user’s money ! It saves the environment, instead of creating unnecessary e-waste by
throwing out perfectly usable technology. We can make a meaningful change to this
throwaway economy that we live in. Just keep using things as long as it works ! The
                                                                          

                                                                          
more easily replaceable and repairable parts that are in our gadgets, the better it is for
users. That means the manufacturers and companies making these things are on
complete opposite side of that equation, they’re gonna want a control of it.
<br class='newline' />Once we buy a technology their best interest is retain as much control over that
technology. Because everything about this transaction is better for them if they have
more control. They can keep selling us accessories and everything made for that
technology. They can continue to make money off of the thing they have sold to us.
Companies and manufacturers should not control everything, that would be a
Monopoly! <br class='newline' />
</p><!-- l. 431 --><p class='indent'>   These days technology is getting very complicated !! As technology is getting better,
it’s getting more and more well optimised and more tightly integrated. Parts are
connected to each other more, they talk to each other faster, as these things happens,
things are getting less repairable at the same time. Maybe 80s and 90s were the golden
age of technology.
</p><!-- l. 433 --><p class='indent'>   Technology can be mainly classified by two different categories:
</p><!-- l. 435 --><p class='indent'>
      </p><ol class='enumerate1'>
      <li class='enumerate' id='x6-32002x1'>Repairs that are more difficult due to technological progress.
      </li>
      <li class='enumerate' id='x6-32004x2'>Repairs are more difficult because of the manufacturers just like a better way
      to put it.</li></ol>
<!-- l. 440 --><p class='indent'>   Repairable things does not mean that we need to go back to the stone age. The
problem is not with the smaller or the harder repairs, it is innovators responsibility to
figure out how to fix or repair the technology when it gets better, snaller or more
integrated. It is not about larger board becomes a tiny chip, but at least we would be able
to repair the device which we own. <br class='newline' />
</p><!-- l. 442 --><p class='indent'>   The ultimate truth is technology is going continue to evolve so those who repair
technology will also continue to evolve and continue to meet that particular challenge.
                                                                          

                                                                          
So Well-written and well considered legislation (which does not allow anticonsumer,
anti-competitive, and anti-repair behaviour of many manufacturers and companies)
would help to shape the better future.
</p><!-- l. 445 --><p class='indent'>   "Future of technology is set by the promoters of new technologies." <br class='newline' />This kind of thinking has to be change. The future of technology should be always based
on the end-user. It should not be like pushing services/products on users, rather creating
demand for pull of better services and better products.
</p><!-- l. 448 --><p class='indent'>   " When we are talk about technology from on we are made to think about novelty
and the future. For many decades now the term ‘technology’ has been closely linked
with invention (the creation of new idea) and innovation (the first use of a new idea)"
<br class='newline' />In the new economy, in new times this looks like a very vague statement. Think about a
cooking recipe, if you are the best chef in the world then, Do you keep your cooking
recipe Secret? Will you have fear of losing your recipe? will you exclusively charge your
foodie customers for understanding the recipe? or, will you charge your foodie customers
for enjoying the tasty food? <br class='newline' />Anyways, the sad truth is there will be always somebody who will come up with the
better taste and healthy food recipe than yours so what you’re gonna do? Will you be still
keep selling your old-fashioned food recipe? <br class='newline' />So better advice is always keep sharing the best skills you’ve acquired so that new ideas
could always keep on adding to the existing things. <br class='newline' />There’s a nice thing about cooking, we can’t really increase or decrease all the
ingredients in the same proportion in a recipe, their relative contribution to the recipe
is different, so we need to realise on contribution of each ingredient in the
recipe.
